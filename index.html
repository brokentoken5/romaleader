<h2>
 Death & My Opinion     </h2>
  
    <p>
     
      Augustus died on august 19, 14 ad

      Augustus died of natural causes. Unlike his great uncle.
      His sun immediately took over the throne, after his death.
      <br>
      <hr>
      I think he was a very respectable and nice emperor. He was a man of principles, and help the plebeians.
      He made the building blocks of rome. He built roads and more helpful laws.
